# RbxSync2 - Like RbxSync only it doesn't take 70% of your CPU.

RbxSync2 is a rewrite of the [RbxSync server](https://github.com/evaera/RbxSync) to avoid the use of Electron. Note this is only the SERVER, and does not provide the plugin that RbxSync provides.

It is recommended not to update RbxSync until it has been confirmed the RbxSync2 server is prepared for it.

## Last Confirmed Working Build of RbxSync
v1.3.4 (BUILD 16)

## Downloads
RbxSync2 can be downloaded in the [releases section](https://github.com/boynedmaster/RbxSync2/releases/latest).

RbxSync (the plugin) can be downloaded in [RbxSync's release section](https://github.com/evaera/RbxSync/releases/latest). Simply download it, run it, and then once the plugin has been installed, close the server and then run RbxSync2.

## Issues
There are many known issues with editing scripts inside studio and with your editor at the same time. It is recommended you only use your external editor to write scripts. 

Other issues include Watchdog (the file watching tool RbxSync2 uses) not having permissions on files. The reason for this is unknown.

## Donate
RbxSync2 is free software. If you would like to fund this or other projects of mine, you can donate to me on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/kampfkarren). 

I am also trying to get into the developer forums on Roblox, so you can help out for free by making a nomination for me (Kampfkarren).
